description: Copying posts into a hosted microblog.

If you have multiple blogs, hosted on Micro.blog or elsewhere, you can add each RSS or JSON feed to your Micro.blog account by clicking Account → Edit Feeds & Cross-posting. Any posts in those feeds will be added to the Micro.blog timeline, and anyone following you will see those posts.

Other times you might maintain an external blog (such as on WordPress) and want those posts to be copied automatically to your Micro.blog-hosted blog at your-username.micro.blog. You can use a service like IFTTT or Zapier to copy the posts from an RSS feed and then post them to your account via the [Micropub API](http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/).

In IFTTT:

1. Start by [creating a new applet](https://ifttt.com/create).
2. For the "if this" part of the applet, add an RSS feed trigger. Enter your WordPress RSS feed URL, usually `http://your-domain.com/feed/`.
3. For the "then that" part of the applet, search for "Webhooks" and add the "Make a new request" action.
4. In the URL, enter `https://micro.blog/micropub`. Set the method to `POST` and the content-type to `application/x-form-url-encoded`.
5. In the body, paste in this example:

{% raw %}
```
access_token=ABCDEF&content=<<{{EntryContent}}>>&name=<<{{FeedTitle}}>>
```
{% endraw %}

Replace ABCDEF with a Micro.blog app token. You can generate a new app token for IFTTT under Account → Edit Apps on Micro.blog on the web.

Now when the applet runs, it will take the latest posts from your external blog's RSS feed and send them to Micro.blog as new posts.
