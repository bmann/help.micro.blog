At Micro.blog, we believe there needs to be a line between the social network and the content at your own site. Your web site is your own, where you have the freedom to write about whatever you want, but a service like Micro.blog has a responsibility to build a safe community for its users.

The primary focus of the community guidelines will be replies posted to other Micro.blog users. Many great friendships and interesting conversations can start as an @-reply. We are committed to making Micro.blog a place where these interactions can happen. Unfortunately, abuse and harassment frequently come in the form of an @-reply from someone you don't follow. 

**To combat this type of abuse and harassment, Micro.blog has a feature called Safe Replies.** Safe Replies attempts to automatically catch potentially harmful replies to you from people you do not follow. We use this to help filter posts out of your timeline that you may not want to see.

**We may also curate replies to protect users when emerging problems are not automatically flagged.** Replies will be subject to the basic community guidelines below. They will also be subject to review if flagged by Safe Replies or reported to the community manager by other users.

**If you are being harassed on Micro.blog, or if you notice someone else being harassed, please contact the Micro.blog Community Manager at [community@micro.blog](mailto:community@micro.blog).** The Micro.blog team will keep the names of those who report harassment confidential.

The community guidelines also apply to content that appears on Micro.blog. Our mission is to foster a community that values respect and open communication in an atmosphere that is free of abuse or intimidation. Blog content hosted by Micro.blog will be subject to the community guidelines below.

The following will not be tolerated in @-replies or in posts (including photos) that appear on Micro.blog.

* **Hate speech:** Content that attacks other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. We will not host microblogs whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.
* **Threats of violence:** You may not threaten violence towards others or use the platform to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism.
* **Harassment:** Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted @-reply messages.
* **Posting private information (aka doxxing):** You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address, or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission. In addition, you may not post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent.
* **Illegal activities**: You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities. International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.

_What Happens If Someone Violates These Guidelines_

We recognize that the circumstances under which a violation has occurred will vary, and we will tailor our response to the situation that has been reported. We'll review each abuse report on a case-by-case basis. In each case. The actions that we will take include, but are not limited to, the following:

* A warning to discontinue behavior that violates the guidelines, with specific details on how the guidelines have been violated. Repeated warnings will lead to blocking and removal from Micro.blog.
* Posting to Micro.blog-hosted sites will be temporarily or permanently disabled.
* Specific posts will be blocked from Micro.blog.
* Mentions will be hidden from the default timeline for a user.
* Micro.blog account will be closed.

Thanks for helping us encourage a safe and welcoming community on Micro.blog. We'll update these guidelines as needed.
