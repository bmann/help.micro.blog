Some themes include a custom "404 not found" page when a visitor to your blog tries to request a page that is no longer on the web, or if they mistype a URL. You can override this page in 2 different ways:

* The easiest way is to create a new Micro.blog page under Posts â†’ Pages. For the title, type "404" and save the page. Micro.blog will notice that special title and automatically set up the page filename to be `/404.html`. You can later edit the title or text content to anything you want.
* If you need more control, use a custom Micro.blog theme to add a new template in `layouts/404.html`. This can use any Hugo includes to show headers, footers, or handle other logic.

When neither of these pages are found, Micro.blog will return a basic "Not Found" page.
