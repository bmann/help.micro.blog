Micro.blog offers an optional paid plan that lets you create a short-form podcast hosted directly on Micro.blog. You can upload an MP3 for your microcast from the web, or use the companion iPhone app [Wavelength](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696?ls=1&mt=8) to record, edit, and publish a new episode.

Hosted microcasts use a separate RSS feed for your episodes: /podcast.xml. You can add this feed to apps like Overcast or Castro, or register it with the Apple Podcast Directory. Just like a regular microblog, you can also use a custom domain for your site.
