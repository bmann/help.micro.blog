Micro.blog offers an optional paid plan that lets you create a short-form podcast hosted directly on Micro.blog. You can upload an MP3 for your microcast from the web, or use the companion iPhone app [Wavelength](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696?ls=1&mt=8) to record, edit, and publish a new episode.

Hosted microcasts use a separate RSS feed for your episodes: yourdomain.com/podcast.xml. You can add this feed to apps like Overcast or Castro, or register it with the Apple Podcast Directory. Just like a regular microblog, you can also use a custom domain for your site.

To upload an MP3 on the web, under "New Post" click the audio button to select a file:

MP3s should be 25 MB or less. The following list shows an estimate for how long episodes can be depending on the audio encoding:

* 64 kbps: 53 minutes
* 96 kbps: 35 minutes
* 112 kbps: 30 minutes
* 128 kbps: 26 minutes (used in Wavelength)
* 192 kbps: 17 minutes

Micro.blog uses your profile photo for the cover artwork. If you haven't uploaded a custom profile photo recently, add one under [Account](https://micro.blog/account) on the web. Micro.blog will save a high-resolution version (1400x1400) to use with podcast clients.

By default, microcasts are set to the iTunes category "Society & Culture - Personal Journals". You can select a different category from the list under Pages â†’ "Edit Domain & Design". When you register your podcast with Apple, it uses this category for the podcast directory.
