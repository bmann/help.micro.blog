Posts on Micro.blog can contain photos. For short posts without a title, Micro.blog will show any inline photos directly in the timeline.

To post a photo on the web, click "New Post", then click the camera icon to select a photo to upload. You can also use the native iOS or macOS app to post photos, or a third-party app.

Micro.blog defaults to including the text of your post first, followed by one or more photos. If you'd like to mix text and photos in a different order, you can edit the post on the web under Posts to change the HTML, or use another app such as our app [Sunlit](https://sunlit.io/) for iOS or [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) on the web.

Photos in a post use standard HTML `img` tags. We recommend you always specify `width` and `height` attributes if you are composing the HTML yourself. Micro.blog's cross-posting checks the photo size and skips anything smaller than 100x100 to avoid accidentally posting icons or tracking pixels that are sometimes present in external blogs.
