In addition to hosting podcasts and video, Micro.blog Premium will archive the contents of bookmarked web pages, with a special reader interface for highlighting text. You can quickly create a new blog post from highlights in Micro.blog.

To bookmark a web page from a web browser, <a href="javascript:location.href='https://micro.blog/bookmark?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)">drag this bookmarklet link</a> to your browser's favorites bar. Click the bookmarklet when visiting a web page to add the URL in Micro.blog.

To bookmark a web page from iOS, install the Micro.blog iOS app and select the "Save as bookmark" setting inside the iOS app. You can then share URLs from mobile Safari and other apps to Micro.blog.
