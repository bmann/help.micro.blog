The best way to control your content on the web is to have your own domain name. You can bring an existing domain name to Micro.blog and use it with your blog, or you can [register a domain name directly on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/domains). We'll handle everything for you, with the name servers managed by Name.com.

When you register a domain name on Micro.blog, the yearly registration fee is added to your existing subscription. You'll see it as a new line item on your invoice for the current month. You need to have an active subscription and payment information on file to register a domain name. (We never share any payment information with Name.com.)

After the registration goes through, you'll receive an email from Name.com asking to verify your contact information. Make sure to click the link in this email so that your domain name remains active.
