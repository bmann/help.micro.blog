description: Posting with Micropub API clients.

In addition to [the official iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8), there is a growing list of third-party apps that work with Micro.blog. Because [Micro.blog supports the Micropub API](http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/) for hosted blogs, many existing Micropub clients can be used to post to Micro.blog. Here are a few that we've tested with:

* [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) — Web browser client that can post to Micro.blog and upload photos.
* [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/) — Automatically posts your Instagram photos to your microblog.
* [Omnibear](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibear/cjieakdeocmiimmphkfhdfbihhncoocn) — Chrome extension for simple posting.
* [Micropublish](https://micropublish.net/) — Another web client for posting notes or reposts.

There are also some apps specifically for Micro.blog:

* [TodayPoster](https://github.com/bryanluby/TodayPoster) — macOS Today Widget for posting.
* [MicroBlog Desktop](http://matthewroach.me/micro-blog-desktop/) — macOS app built with Electron.

If you have any issues connecting from a Micropub client, [see our help page about OwnYourGram](http://help.micro.blog/2017/instagram/) for tips.
