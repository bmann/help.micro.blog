Because [Micro.blog supports the Micropub API](http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/) for hosted blogs, many existing Micropub clients can be used to post to Micro.blog. Here are a few that we've tested with:

* [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) — Web browser client that can post to Micro.blog and upload photos.
* [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/) — Automatically posts your Instagram photos to your microblog.
* [Omnibear](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibear/cjieakdeocmiimmphkfhdfbihhncoocn) — Chrome extension for simple posting.

If you have any issues connecting from a Micropub client, [see our help page about OwnYourGram](http://help.micro.blog/2017/instagram/) for tips.
