There are serveral ways to share photos with micro.blog users from iOS devices. Here is a summary of the main methods from our apps along with some of the different capabilities each provides.

**The Micro.blog app** This is probably the first app you encountered for posting to the timeline. In addition to enabling both short and long form posts this app can be used to post one or more photos from the iOS Photos app to your timeline. Simply start a new post and then click the camera icon bottom left to add the photo. If you want to include additional photos repeat the process of selecting the camera and picking a photo. The photos will be constrained to a square aspect ratio by default, click the small expansion icon bottom left before adding the photo in order to adjust this. You can also choose from a set of built-in photo filters in the same fashion. If your post is short form, defined as less than 280 characters, the text as well as thumbnails of the photo(s) will appear in the timeline. If your post is long form the title and text go on the timeline and the photo is available after clicking the link to view the full post.
