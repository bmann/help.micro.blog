Sunlit for iOS is all about photos. Follow friends, reply, view conversations, and publish photos to your own blog hosted by Micro.blog or compatible blogs such as WordPress.

You can [download Sunlit in the App Store here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769?ls=1&mt=8).

Sunlit‚Äôs timeline is built on the Micro.blog timeline. When you follow someone in either Micro.blog or Sunlit, their photo posts are added to the Sunlit timeline. It‚Äôs strictly reverse-chronological based on who you‚Äôre following. No ads. No algorithms.

This quick video shows how scrolling through the timeline works, and how to reply to posts and view conversations.

For Sunlit 3.0, we‚Äôve redesigned the new post screen to be faster and more flexible than the previous version. It‚Äôs great for posting a quick single photo, but it can scale up to full blog posts with multiple sections of text and photos

Sunlit lets you structure the blog post in sections that can each have one or more photos. It then uploads the photos to your blog along with the HTML layout for the post.

<hr />

Both Sunlit and Micro.blog use Discover to help you find people to follow. Because Sunlit is all about photos, Sunlit takes the usual Discover sections from Micro.blog, but shows only the photos from each section instead of all post types.

For example, tapping on üìö at the top of Discover will show microblog posts that have used the books emoji along with a photo, which will often be a book cover or other photo of the book. Tapping on üß∂ will usually show people‚Äôs knitting or crochet projects. Tapping on ‚òïÔ∏è will show coffee-related photos. Tapping on üçû will show baking.

It‚Äôs a great way to discover people to follow even if they haven‚Äôt posted a recent photo that you might see in the main üì∑ photos section.

<hr />

Micro.blog is based on blogs and IndieWeb standards so that it can integrate well with the rest of the web, not be walled off like a silo. One aspect of this is that you can follow many blogs in Micro.blog even if the author of the blog hasn‚Äôt registered on Micro.blog yet, similar to how you can subscribe to blogs in a feed reader like NetNewsWire or Feedbin.

For Sunlit, there‚Äôs special support for searching for Tumblr blogs so that they are easy to follow directly from within Sunlit. Use the search under the Discover tab to enter the domain name to follow, as shown in this series of screenshots:

There is expanded support for following other blogs and even Mastodon users in Micro.blog itself. You can always use Micro.blog to find a blog to follow, then go back to Sunlit and those posts will appear in the Sunlit timeline.
