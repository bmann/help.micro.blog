Micro.blog supports hosting videos on your blog and showing videos in the timeline. You can upload videos with the $10/month Micro.blog hosting plan, which also includes audio hosting and a podcast feed.

[Click here for more details](https://micro.blog/new/audio) about video hosting or to upgrade your blog.

When you post a video from the iOS or macOS apps — or our companion iOS app for photos, Sunlit — Micro.blog adds the following HTML to your post. If you host a blog somewhere else outside of Micro.blog, you can adopt similar markup to be compatible with Micro.blog's timeline.

```html
<video controls="controls" playsinline="playsinline" src="https://example.com/test.mov" poster="https://example.com/poster.png" preload="none" width="400" height="400" alt=""></video>
```

Third-party apps can upload videos just as they would upload photos. First upload the video to the Micropub API's media endpoint, then include the URL to that new video in the `video` parameter along with your text when publishing the post. Micro.blog will automatically add the HTML tag and also create the poster frame PNG for you.

Micro.blog uploads can be up to 45 MB. Videos can usually be up to 1-2 minutes when uploading from the Micro.blog apps, which scale down your videos if necessary. To upload your own edited video without Micro.blog modifying it, use the Posts → Uploads section of Micro.blog on the web.
