The iOS and Mac apps for Micro.blog support a special URL scheme to send text that you want to post. Opening these URLs will fill in the post text in Micro.blog, where you can edit or post it.

```
microblog://post?text=Hello%20world
```

For posting directly to Micro.blog-hosted blogs without using the apps, [see the posting API](http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/).
