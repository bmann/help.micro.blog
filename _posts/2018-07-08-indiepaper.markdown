description: Save articles to read later.
---

[Indiepaper](https://indiepaper.io/) is a new service for saving the text of articles you find on the web and want to read later. It's in the spirit of Instapaper or Pocket, but built on IndieWeb technologies.

_Support for Indiepaper in Micro.blog should be considered experimental. We think this has a lot of potential, but we'd like to hear from the community on how best to integrate "read later" features into the full Micro.blog platform._

To use Indiepaper, sign in with Micro.blog [on this page at Indiepaper.io](https://www.indiepaper.io/indieauth.html). You'll be asked to allow access to your Micro.blog account. A paid subscription to a Micro.blog-hosted blog is required to use Indiepaper.

Follow the instructions on the Indiepaper site to use the bookmarklet, iOS workflow, or macOS app to save articles to your reading queue. Micro.blog then makes these saved articles available in a special feed. To read the saved articles, subscribe to this feed in a feed reader that supports JSON Feed like [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) or [Evergreen](https://ranchero.com/evergreen/).

You can find your unique feed URL by going to Account â†’ Edit Feeds in your web browser on Micro.blog.
