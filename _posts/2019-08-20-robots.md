By default Micro.blog creates a `robots.txt` file for your site that allows Google and other search engines to index all the blog posts and pages on your site.

If you'd like to disable generating the `robots.txt` file, you can override it with a [custom theme](https://help.micro.blog/2019/about-themes/). Create a template named `config.json` in your theme with the following contents:

```json
{
  "enableRobotsTXT": false
}
```

You can also add custom rules to the `robots.txt` file. Create a new template named `layouts/robots.txt` in a custom theme with contents such as:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /some-page-here
```
