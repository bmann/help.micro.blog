By default, Micro.blog shows the most recent posts on your blog's home page. You can override this by creating a custom theme with a different home page layout that includes any text.

Start by clicking Posts → Design → Edit Custom Themes. Create a new template named `layouts/index.html` and paste in the following:

```
{% raw %}{{ define "main" }}
  This is the home page.
{{ end }}{ % endraw %}
```

You can replace the content in the middle with any HTML. The special `{% raw %}{{ define }}{% endraw %}` tag will automatically wrap your text with the blog's default design.

Go back to your site settings under Posts → Design and select the new theme, then click Update Microblog Settings.
