In addition to [the official iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8), there is a growing list of third-party apps that work with Micro.blog. Because [Micro.blog supports the Micropub API](/2017/api-posting/) for hosted blogs, many existing Micropub clients can be used to post to Micro.blog. Here are a few that we've tested with:

* [MarsEdit](/2015/using-marsedit/) — Full-featured native macOS blogging app.
* [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) — Web browser client that can post to Micro.blog and upload photos.
* [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/) — Automatically posts your Instagram photos to your microblog.
* [OwnYourSwarm](https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io/) — Automatically posts your Swarm check-ins to your microblog.
* [IndieBookClub](https://indiebookclub.biz/) — Post what books you're reading to Micro.blog.
* [Omnibear](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibear/cjieakdeocmiimmphkfhdfbihhncoocn) — Chrome or Firefox extension for simple posting.
* [Micropublish](https://micropublish.net/) — Another web client for posting notes or reposts.

There are also some apps specifically for Micro.blog:

* [Icro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icro/id1375296597?ls=1&mt=8) — iOS app for Micro.blog with timeline, posting, and more.
* [Dialog](https://dialogapp.net/) — Android app for Micro.blog!
* [Gluon](https://gluon.app/) — Cross-platform app for iOS and Android.
* [TodayPoster](https://github.com/bryanluby/TodayPoster) — macOS Today Widget for posting.
* [MicroBlog Desktop](http://matthewroach.me/micro-blog-desktop/) — macOS app built with Electron.
