Now that Micro.blog is available to Kickstarter backers and more users, we're working on many improvements leading up to the public launch. Here are some of the features and bugs we're working on:

* Connectivity problems (blank screens) on some cellular networks.
* More hosted microblog themes.
* Prompting to automatically renew Facebook authentication, which expires after 60 days.
* Improvements to @-mention support to be more consistent across blogs.

We've recently finished these changes:

* Fixed sharing photos from other iOS apps.
* Added Posts link to the navbar and improved access to editing posts.
* Added support for scrolling back further in the timeline on iOS and macOS.
* Added an official Mac app, plus updates to the iOS version for the iPhone X.
* Fixed some pins not getting automatically unlocked.
* Improved Discover screens to show a timeline of a selection of posts from the community.
* Added export in WordPress's WXR file format.
* Added a link from `your-username.micro.blog` to your profile page.
* Added better post browsing, editing, and deleting under Account â†’ Posts.
* Added SSL for custom domains. Email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog) and we'll enable it for you.
* Added Markdown highlighting for web replies.
* Added Facebook cross-posting.
* Added repost support from Micropub clients such as Micropublish.
* Improved Micropub API with support for [OwnYourGram](http://help.micro.blog/2017/instagram/).
* Improved published blog filenames and removed unnecessarily titles in Hyde theme.
* Added iPad support to the iOS app and made it available [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8).
* Added user search from the iOS app.
* Improved @-mentions from regular, non-reply microblog posts to auto-link usernames. If the post starts with an @-mention, it will be stored separately and not cross-posted to Twitter.
* Improved cross-posting to extract inline links and append them at the end of the tweet.
* Updated links and Twitter cross-posts to use custom domain names.
* Added Markdown and auto-linking URLs in mentions.
* Added showing conversation view in iPhone from push notifications.
* Added a Discover page on the web and in the iPhone app to find users.
* Fixed uploading large photos from the iPhone app.
* Fixed slow publishing of new posts.
* Fixed feeds refresh not working for some sites.
* Fixed escaping HTML in new posts and replies on the web.
* Fixed invites not showing the correct Kickstarter reward.
* Fixed dates on timeline not reflecting current timezone.
* Fixed custom CSS being cleared and not included in Primrose theme.
