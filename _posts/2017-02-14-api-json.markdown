The JSON API is based on [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/), the same format as the JSON versions of the [hosted site feeds](/2017/api-feeds/). Micro.blog adds a few useful fields under an extension named `_microblog`. A response with posts looks like this:

```
{
  "title": "Micro.blog - Mentions", 
  "home_page_url": "https://micro.blog/mentions", 
  "feed_url": "https://micro.blog/posts/mentions", 
  "_microblog": {
    "about": "https://micro.blog/about/api"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "author": {
        "name": "Manton Reece", 
        "url": "http://manton.org", 
        "avatar": "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d848ac9a3c64d1b73563895892cb2819?s=96",
        "_microblog": {
          "username": "manton",
          "is_following": true
        }
      }, 
      "url": "https://micro.blog/manton/123", 
      "content_html": "<a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">@manton</a> Testing testing, hello world.", 
      "date_published": "2017-02-24T15:38:50-06:00", 
      "_microblog": {
        "is_deletable": true, 
        "is_favorite": false, 
        "date_relative": "3:38 pm"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following endpoints are supported:

* `POST /account/signin` — Pass `email`, `app_name`, and `redirect_url` parameters to let the user sign in via a confirmation email. Send us an email to help@micro.blog so we can enable this for your app. The user can also generate app tokens under Account → Edit Apps. Web apps should use IndieAuth for sign-in.
* `GET /posts/all` — JSON timeline for the signed-in user.
* `GET /posts/mentions` — JSON mentions for the signed-in user.
* `GET /posts/favorites` — JSON favorites for the signed-in user.
* `GET /posts/photos` — Photos-only timeline for the signed-in user.
* `GET /posts/discover` — JSON for featured posts.
* `GET /posts/discover/[collection]` — Emoji collections, e.g. "books" and "music".
* `GET /posts/[username]` — JSON posts written by the given user.
* `GET /posts/conversation?id=[id]` — JSON thread for a reply.
* `GET /posts/check?since_id=[id]` — Check whether there are new posts in the timeline. The response also includes a suggestion for the number of seconds to wait before polling again.
* `POST /posts/favorites` — Favorite a post. Pass an `id`.
* `DELETE /posts/favorites/[id]` — Unfavorite a post. Pass an `id`.
* `POST /posts/reply` — Post a reply to an `id` with `text` param.
* `DELETE /posts/[id]` — Delete one of your posts, replies, or favorites for the given `id`.
* `POST /users/follow` — Follow user with `username` param.
* `POST /users/unfollow` — Unfollow `username`.
* `GET /users/is_following?username=[username]` — Check if you're following `username`.
* `GET /users/following/[username]` — List of users `username` is following.
* `GET /users/discover/[username]` — List of users `username` is following that signed-in user isn't. The count for this is in `discover_count` from `/posts/[username]`.
* `POST /micropub` — Posting for a hosted microblog uses the Micropub API. [See the documentation](http://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/) for more information about posting.

You should pass an authorization token as an HTTP header. This token can be retrieved via `/account/signin` or by the user under Account → Edit Apps. This is what sending the HTTP token looks like:

```
GET /posts/all
Authorization: Token 123456789
```

Note: IDs are 64-bit and unique across all posts, mentions, and favorites. Pass `count`, `since_id`, and `before_id` params for paging.
