Micro.blog doesn't have passwords. The easiest way to sign in with the iOS app is to enter your email address when you first launch the app. Micro.blog will send you an email with a link to tap to be signed in.

You can also use a special auth token to sign in with the iOS app, instead of typing in your email address. These tokens are managed on the Micro.blog web site. You can think of them as very strong passwords, but instead of having a single password for the whole service, you'll use unique passwords (tokens) for each application you want to use.

To find your app token, go to Micro.blog and click on Account, then scroll down to the "App tokens" section. You should see a unique token already generated for you. Just copy it to the clipboard and paste it into the sign-in screen on the Micro.blog iOS app. (Storing the token in a password manager like [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) can be helpful here.)

You only need to sign in once. After that, Micro.blog on iOS will remember you on that device.
