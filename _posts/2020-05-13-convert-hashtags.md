[Categories in Micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/2020/categories/) are a great way to organize your posts. When you use categories, visitors to your blog can browse just those posts, and you can also provide RSS feeds for specific categories.

Some apps such as [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) use hashtags to organize posts. When you publish to Micro.blog, those tags will be included in the blog post content. You can use Micro.blog filters to automatically assign categories based on those tags.

Here's what a post might look like in iA Writer, using the hashtag `#travel`:

<img src="/assets/images/web/hashtags-iawriter.png" alt="iA Writer screenshot" border="0" width="231" height="500" style="max-width: 231px;" />

In Micro.blog, click Posts → Categories → Edit Filters to create a new filter. For the text content, enter `#travel` and pick a category to assign:

<img src="/assets/images/web/hashtags-filter.png" alt="Hashtags filter screenshot" border="0" width="499" height="156" style="max-width: 499px;" />

Note that the hashtag will still appear in your blog post, although you can edit it out later if you want to.
