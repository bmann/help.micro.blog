Don't let the name fool you. While Micro.blog is focused on short posts because we think it encourages people to write more often, you can just as easily publish long-form essays or posts with multiple paragraphs.

Micro.blog uses a post's title field to determine whether a post should be treated as a microblog post or a full blog post. When you type over 280 characters on the web or in the official iOS and macOS apps, Micro.blog will automatically reveal a title field. Just give your post a title to turn it into a full blog post.

In [the macOS app](/2017/mac-version/), you can also choose the View menu â†’ Title Field to show or hide the title field while writing a new post.
