Don't let the name fool you. While Micro.blog is focused on short posts because we think it encourages people to write more often, you can just as easily publish long-form essays or posts with multiple paragraphs.

When you type over 280 characters on the web or in the official iOS and macOS apps, Micro.blog will automatically reveal a title field. Just give your post a title to turn it into a full blog post. On the timeline, the title will appear, linked to your post.

In [the macOS app](/2017/mac-version/), while you are composing a post, you can also choose **View â†’ Title Field** from the menu to reveal the title field. (This is also helpful if you want to give a title to a post that is shorter than 280 characters.)

Even if your post is long, you are not required to have a title on Micro.blog. In the timeline, the post will appear truncated to approximately than 280 characters, and will have a link to the complete post on your blog.
