### On Micro.blog, you control your own content.

Tweeting is one form of microblogging. But when you use Twitter, your content stays at Twitter. At Micro.blog, you can write short posts that appear in the Micro.blog timeline, as well as on your own blog that you control.

That’s the most important thing to understand about Micro.blog. It is a bit like Twitter, in that you can share short thoughts, links, and photos with those who follow you, but it also offers tools and hosting similar to WordPress for short-form content.

### Micro.blog is serious about preventing abuse and harassment.

The next most important thing to understand about Micro.blog is that the platform was designed, from the beginning, to prevent abuse and harassment. Your microblog is your own, where you are free to write about whatever you want, but we protect the timeline, where you can @-reply others, through a variety of tools and curation. We have community guidelines that are enforced.

### You can cross-post from Micro.blog to Twitter. 

All your Micro.blog posts will appear in your Twitter timeline, if you choose, or you can selectively post only some of them. 

### Micro.blog is not an attempt to duplicate or replace Twitter. 

Because our focus is on supporting thoughtful content creation and avoiding the pitfalls of social networks, we don’t have features you are familiar with from Twitter.

- We don’t reveal followers or follower counts. We do reveal who you are following, which you have control over. It helps other microbloggers find new people to follow.

- We don’t have the equivalent of retweets or likes. If you like something and want the author to know it, you can reply. We believe this encourages more thoughtful sharing.

- We don't have #hashtag support. We do have a few broad topics, such as books, music, podcasts, that can be discovered through emoji hashtags in the Discover section. We also curate a Discover timeline of posts from community members, which is helpful for finding new microblogs to follow.

As Micro.blog evolves, we may add features like these. We consider new features very carefully, and we err on the side of not adding them until we are confident they won’t have a deleterious effect on the community.

Micro.blog doesn’t have a tool for automatically following people you already follow on Twitter. We do have a Discover tab, which is a curated version of the general timeline, so you can find new people to follow. You can search for users by name and handle. You can also look at who other microbloggers are following. Once a week, we have Micro Monday (our answer to Follow Friday), where users recommend one person to follow.
