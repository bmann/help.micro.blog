Micro.blog version 1.7 and later on iOS 13 support _Sign in with Apple_. It can be used to sign in to an existing Micro.blog account, or to create a brand new Micro.blog account right from iOS.

If you have an existing Micro.blog account and use _Sign in with Apple_ with the same email address, you'll be signed in to your current account. If you pick an email address that doesn't match the email address used in Micro.blog, or if you choose Apple's private email relay, Micro.blog will create a new account and start a hosted blog trial for you.

A few things to be aware of:

* You can have multiple email addresses associated with your Apple ID. When signing in, make sure to pick the one that is used by Micro.blog.
* If you accidentally create a new Micro.blog account, you'll want to [delete it](https://help.micro.blog/2019/deleting-account/) so that you can sign in to your real account.
* Micro.blog cannot currently send email through Apple's private relay service. This is a known issue from Apple and is affecting many developers.
