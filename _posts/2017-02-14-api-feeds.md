RSS and JSON feeds are available for hosted blogs and to retrieve the timeline for any user. These feeds do not need authentication. Be reasonable about how often you hit them.

**RSS feeds** are available at these URLs:

* `https://micro.blog/feeds/username.xml` — Friends' posts for what the specified user sees in their timeline.
* `https://username.micro.blog/feed.xml` — Posts for the published microblog.

**JSON versions** in [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) format are available at these URLs:

* `https://micro.blog/feeds/username.json` — Friends' posts for what the specified user sees in their timeline.
* `https://micro.blog/feeds/photos.json` — Featured photos across Micro.blog.
* `https://username.micro.blog/feed.json` — Posts for the published microblog.
* `https://micro.blog/posts/discover` — Posts for the Discover section.
* `https://micro.blog/posts/discover/books` — Posts for a specific emoji like "books". [See the emoji help page](/2018/tagmoji/) for details.

In addition to RSS and JSON, the HTML for all hosted microblogs are marked up with **Microformats** using these class names:

* `h-feed`
* `h-entry`
* `u-url`
* `dt-published`
* `e-content`

**Real-time posting** is possible with WebSub or by sending a "ping" to Micro.blog when you post to your blog. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">WebSub</a> (formerly PubSubHubbub) lets Micro.blog subscribe to your feed and get notified whenever you post. WordPress.com and some other services support WebSub automatically.

To tell Micro.blog to refresh a feed right away, you can send a ping from your blogging software. In WordPress, add `https://micro.blog/ping` in WordPress under Settings → Writing → "Update Services". WordPress will send an XML-RPC request for `weblogUpdates.ping`. You can also `POST /ping` and pass an `url` for the RSS feed.
