So you've created an account on Micro.blog. Thanks! We're glad to have you. Here are the steps to take next.

**First**, create a new microblog or tell Micro.blog about your existing blog:

* If you don't have an existing blog, consider letting Micro.blog host it for you by choosing "New..." → "New microblog site". You'll get everything you need: a new blog, posting from the web or iPhone, photo hosting, and the ability to map a personal domain name to your blog.
* If you already have a blog, such as one based on WordPress, connect it to Micro.blog by adding the feed URL to your account under Account → "Edit Feeds". Now all your blog posts will appear under your Micro.blog profile and in the timeline of friends who are following you.

**Second**, verify that you are the author of your microblog:

* If you have a Micro.blog-hosted blog, this is handled for you automatically. Otherwise you can follow [these instructions](http://help.micro.blog/2017/web-site-verification/).

**Next**, follow some other Micro.blog users:

* You can find users in the [Discover](https://micro.blog/discover) of Micro.blog. It's a random selection of featured users, so reload the page for more suggestions. There's also a search box if you know the name of a user you want to follow.
* In the [Indie Microblogging Slack](https://microblogging.slack.com/), check out the #followme channel. If you're not on Slack yet, you can [sign up here](https://micro.blog/slack).

**Finally**, get the iPhone app:

* Micro.blog includes an iPhone app to make posting on-the-go easier. The app is in beta. Request access to the app by [adding your name to the beta list](https://micro.blog/beta). If you haven't received a TestFlight invite yet, please email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog) to let us know.
* The iPhone app can post to Micro.blog-hosted blogs, WordPress blogs, and microblogs that support the Micropub API. To post to an external blog, tap Settings and select "WordPress or compatible weblog".
