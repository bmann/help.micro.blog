description: Importing photos with the Mac version of Micro.blog.
---

The latest version for the Micro.blog for Mac app can open an archive of your Instagram photos and import them to your blog. To get this archive from Instagram, follow these steps:

* Sign in to Instagram.com on the web.
* [Click this link](https://www.instagram.com/download/request/) to view the Request Download page.
* Instagram will prompt for the email address to deliver a link to the .zip file of all your photos.

After you have the .zip file, double-click on it on your Mac to uncompress it if it wasn't automatically unzipped by your web browser. Then you're ready to import:

* In Micro.blog for Mac, choose File â†’ Import from Instagram.
* Navigate to the downloaded archive folder and select the media.json file.

You can now select a few or all of your photos to import. We recommend starting with just a few to test that everything is working well, and then go back to import additional batches of photos to your blog. Micro.blog will use the current blog you have configured to post to in the app.

A note about multiple-photo posts on Instagram: The archive from Instagram doesn't appear to include the text from Instagram posts that have more than 1 photo. They are also split into multiple blog posts. If you'd like to fix this to combine multiple blog posts, you can edit or delete them from your blog.
