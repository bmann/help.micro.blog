6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").  Be sure to consider whether fair use or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit a notice of infringement.  For more information on fair use, see <https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html>.

Upon receipt of a proper DMCA notice of infringement, we will promptly remove or disable access to the content that is the subject of the notice.

A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice.
