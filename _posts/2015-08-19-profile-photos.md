You can upload a profile photo just for Micro.blog by clicking "Account" on the web. Look for the "Edit" link under your current profile photo. Or, if you're currently signed in, [click here](https://micro.blog/account/photo) to choose a new photo.

A square format image will likely work the best, but is not required, unless you are using Micro.blog to [host your podcast](/2018/microcasting/). The Apple Podcasts Directory requires a profile image be 1400 x 1400 pixels. 

Until you post a profile image, the default light gray circle will appear with your posts in the timeline. (If you have a Gravatar account that uses the same email address as your Micro.blog account, Micro.blog will use your Gravatar profile photo until you upload one to Micro.blog.)
