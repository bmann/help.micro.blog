You can upload a profile photo just for Micro.blog by clicking "Account" on the web. Look for the "Edit" link under your current profile photo. If you're signed in, [click here](https://micro.blog/account/photo) to choose a new photo.

Until there's a profile photo set on your account, Micro.blog will fall back on using [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) to host and manage your user profile photo. This is based on the email address you used when registering on Micro.blog.
