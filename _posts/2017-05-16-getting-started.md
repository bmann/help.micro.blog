So you've created an account on Micro.blog. Thanks! We're glad to have you. Here are the steps to take next.

**First**, create a new microblog or tell Micro.blog about your existing blog:

* If you don't have an existing blog, consider letting Micro.blog host it for you by choosing "Plans" → "New Microblog". You'll get everything you need: a new blog, posting from the web or iPhone, photo hosting, and the ability to map a personal domain name to your blog.
* If you already have a blog, such as one based on WordPress, connect it to Micro.blog by adding the feed URL to your account under Account → "Edit Feeds". Now all your blog posts will appear under your Micro.blog profile and in the timeline of friends who are following you.

**Second**, verify that you are the author of your microblog:

* If you have a Micro.blog-hosted blog, this is handled for you automatically. Otherwise you can follow [these instructions](/2017/web-site-verification/).

**Next**, follow other Micro.blog users:

* You can find users in the [Discover section](https://micro.blog/discover). It's a selection of some of the latest posts on Micro.blog.
* In the [Indie Microblogging Slack](https://microblogging.slack.com/), check out the #followme channel. If you're not on Slack yet, you can [sign up here](https://micro.blog/slack).

**Finally**, get the iPhone app:

* Micro.blog includes an iOS app to make posting on-the-go easier. The app is a universal app for iPhone and iPad. You can [download it on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8).
* The iPhone app can post to Micro.blog-hosted blogs, WordPress blogs, and microblogs that support the Micropub API. To post to an external blog, tap Settings and select "WordPress or compatible weblog".
