**What is Micro.blog?** — A new social network and publishing platform for independent microblogs, created by Manton Reece.

**What are the paid plans on Micro.blog for?** — Micro.blog is free for basic accounts and paid for extra features. Micro.blog can host your microblog for $5/month, including cross-posting to other social media platforms. If you host your own microblog, you can get the cross-posting feature for $2/month. [See this help page](http://help.micro.blog/2018/pricing/) for more details on pricing.

**Why haven't I received my invite yet?** — Invites to Kickstarter backers have all been sent out. Please check your spam folder, if you are a Kickstarter backer and have not received your invite. Emails will come from the address `help@micro.blog` with the subject "Micro.blog invite". If you cannot find your invite, please email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog).

**When I registered my username, my Kickstarter reward did not appear. Do I have to enter a credit card to get my reward?** — For some Kickstarter backers, the reward was not applied. We apologize for the issue, and we've updated all the accounts to fix it. If you've already created a trial microblog, we've credited your account for the extra months. If you've paid for a microblog without seeing the Kickstarter reward, email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog) and we can apply an additional credit to your subscription.

**How do I get the Micro.blog iOS app?** — The app is now available for [download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8). If you had previously downloaded the beta app via TestFlight, please delete that older version from your phone so that it doesn't accidentally open when signing in.

**How do I follow other Micro.blog users?** — You can find new users in the Discover tab on the Micro.blog web site and in the iPhone or Mac apps. You can also check the #followme channel on the Microblogging Slack.

**Am I required to use Gravatar for my profile image?** — No, you can now upload your own profile photo. See the link near the top of the Account page.

**What is the difference between `username.micro.blog` and `micro.blog/username`? Shouldn't these point to the same thing?** — URLs with `username.micro.blog` are independent sites, hosted by Micro.blog. They could just as easily be `mydomain.com`. The `micro.blog/username` page has all your posts — possibly from multiple feeds — as well as the Follow button.

**When I try to post to my new microblog from iOS or the Mac, why does it prompt for an external site?** — If you created your hosted microblog after signing in to the native apps, you may need to sign out and then back in from the apps for your new site to be recognized. We're fixing this for the next version.
