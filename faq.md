**What is Micro.blog?** — A new social network and publishing platform for independent microblogs, created by Manton Reece.

**What are the paid plans on Micro.blog for?** — Micro.blog is free for basic accounts and paid for extra features. Micro.blog can host your microblog for $5/month, including cross-posting to other social media platforms. If you host your own microblog, you can get the cross-posting feature for $2/month.

**Why haven't I received my invite yet?** — We are rolling out early access to Micro.blog the week of April 24th, in the order you backed the project. It will take several days to get invites to everyone. Emails will come from the address `help@micro.blog` with the subject "Micro.blog invite".

**When I registered my username, my Kickstarter reward did not appear. Do I have to enter a credit card to get my reward?** — For some Kickstarter backers, the reward was not applied. We apologize for the issue, and we've updated all the accounts to fix it. If you've already created a trial microblog, we've credited your account for the extra months. If you've paid for a microblog without seeing the Kickstarter reward, email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog) and we can apply an additional credit to your subscription.

**I missed the Kickstarter campaign. When can I sign up for a Micro.blog account?** — The public launch date has not yet been set. If you are interested in being notified when it is available, [sign up for the mailing list here](https://micro.blog/list).

**Why are the dates and times on my posts off by a few hours?** — Micro.blog tries to determine your current timezone, but it doesn't work in all cases. We will be fixing this soon and adding an option to choose a timezone.

**How do I get the Micro.blog iPhone app?** — The app is currently in beta. [Sign up here](https://micro.blog/beta) and we will invite you to the next version via Apple's TestFlight.

**How do I follow other Micro.blog users?** — You can search on the Discover tab on the Micro.blog web site and in the iPhone app. You can also check the #followme channel on the Microblogging Slack.

**Am I required to use Gravatar for my profile image?** — Currently, yes. We may expand this to support uploading custom profile images later.

**What is the difference between `username.micro.blog` and `micro.blog/username`? Shouldn't these point to the same thing?** — URLs with `username.micro.blog` are independent sites, hosted by Micro.blog. They could just as easily be `mydomain.com`. The `micro.blog/username` page has all your posts as well as the Follow button.
