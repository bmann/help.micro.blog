**What is Micro.blog?** — A new social network and publishing platform for independent microblogs, created by Manton Reece.

**What are the paid plans on Micro.blog for?** — Micro.blog is free for basic accounts and paid for extra features. Micro.blog can host your microblog for $5/month, including cross-posting to other social media platforms. If you host your own microblog, you can get the cross-posting feature for $2/month. [See this help page](http://help.micro.blog/2018/pricing/) for more details on pricing.

**How do I get the Micro.blog iOS app?** — The app is now available for [download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8). If you had previously downloaded the beta app via TestFlight, please delete that older version from your phone so that it doesn't accidentally open when signing in.

**How do I follow other Micro.blog users?** — You can find new users in the Discover tab on the Micro.blog web site and in the iPhone or Mac apps. You can also check the #followme channel on the Microblogging Slack.

**Am I required to use Gravatar for my profile image?** — No, you can now upload your own profile photo. See the link near the top of the Account page.

**What is the difference between `username.micro.blog` and `micro.blog/username`? Shouldn't these point to the same thing?** — URLs with `username.micro.blog` are independent sites, hosted by Micro.blog. They could just as easily be `mydomain.com`. The `micro.blog/username` page has all your posts — possibly from multiple feeds — as well as the Follow button.

**When I try to post to my new microblog from iOS or the Mac, why does it prompt for an external site?** — If you created your hosted microblog after signing in to the native apps, you may need to sign out and then back in from the apps for your new site to be recognized. We're fixing this for the next version.

**Why do I see all replies in the timeline, even those directed at people I don't follow?** — We wanted to show all replies by default to make it easier to find new users to follow. You can change this setting under Account → Timeline on the web.

**When I tap to stop scrolling in the iOS app, should Micro.blog really show the menu?** — This is a known issue that will be fixed in a future version.
