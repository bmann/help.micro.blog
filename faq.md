**What is Micro.blog?** — A new social network and publishing platform for independent microblogs, created by Manton Reece.

**What are the paid plans on Micro.blog for?** — Micro.blog is free for basic accounts and paid for extra features. Micro.blog can host your microblog for $5/month, including cross-posting to other social media platforms. If you host your own microblog, you can get the cross-posting feature for $2/month.

**Why haven't I received my invite yet?** — Invites to Kickstarter backers have all been sent out. Please check your spam folder, if you are a Kickstarter backer and have not received your invite. Emails will come from the address `help@micro.blog` with the subject "Micro.blog invite". If you cannot find your invite, please email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog).

**When I registered my username, my Kickstarter reward did not appear. Do I have to enter a credit card to get my reward?** — For some Kickstarter backers, the reward was not applied. We apologize for the issue, and we've updated all the accounts to fix it. If you've already created a trial microblog, we've credited your account for the extra months. If you've paid for a microblog without seeing the Kickstarter reward, email [help@micro.blog](mailto:help@micro.blog) and we can apply an additional credit to your subscription.

**I missed the Kickstarter campaign. When can I sign up for a Micro.blog account?** — The public launch date has not yet been set. If you are interested in being notified when it is available, [sign up for the mailing list here](https://micro.blog/list).

**Why are the dates and times on my posts off by a few hours?** — Micro.blog tries to determine your current timezone, but it doesn't work in all cases. We will be fixing this soon and adding an option to choose a timezone.

**How do I get the Micro.blog iOS app?** — The app is now available for [download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micro-blog/id1253201335?ls=1&mt=8). If you had previously downloaded the beta app via TestFlight, please delete that older version from your phone so that it doesn't accidentally open when signing in.

**How do I follow other Micro.blog users?** — You can search on the Discover tab on the Micro.blog web site and in the iPhone app. You can also check the #followme channel on the Microblogging Slack.

**Am I required to use Gravatar for my profile image?** — Currently, yes. We may expand this to support uploading custom profile images later.

**What is the difference between `username.micro.blog` and `micro.blog/username`? Shouldn't these point to the same thing?** — URLs with `username.micro.blog` are independent sites, hosted by Micro.blog. They could just as easily be `mydomain.com`. The `micro.blog/username` page has all your posts as well as the Follow button.
